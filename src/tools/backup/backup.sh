# TODO backup the whole partition after stopping mysql and apache -->instead of stopping apache, mask the app behind a temp page?
# --> do stop here the services? remember that stopping the services is a maint op too, make reusable code.
#Store full mysql dir and also the dump? just in case?
#design recovery to be simpler: start as a new system setup but ask the ssh recovery params (limit the params to be configured to network and data drive? the rest should be inside the recovery just steps 2-4, maybe make another flow and duplicate them). once there is network and a data drive, retrieve the bak file and untar on it. Then, go on with setup. remember to read the vars from disk as if it was a restart, also ask for the usbs to get the recovery key and at the end rewrite them? --> drive and network params must be updated on the recovered config files/usbs, so the order is:
# * Get new network info,
# * setup network
# * get new drive info
# * setup new drive
# * get recovery ssh info.
# * download recovery file on the new drive
# * get usbs and rebuild key
# * extract recovery file on its location and delete the file
# * update disk variables regarding network
# * update usb variables regarding drive
# * go on with the normal setup after the load drive part (including reading the variables)
# * write the usbs with the updated drive config (or do this earlier? No, reuse the code)
